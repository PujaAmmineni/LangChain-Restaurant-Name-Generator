## Restaurant Name Generator
The **Restaurant Name Generator** is a creative application that generates unique restaurant names based on user inputs for cuisine type and menu items. Built with LangChain and Streamlit, it showcases the power of AI-driven solutions.

## Features
- Input cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Chinese, Mexican).
- Add menu items for more personalized suggestions.
- Generate and display creative restaurant names.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/RestaurantNameGenerator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the application directory:
   ```bash
   cd RestaurantNameGenerator
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to access the app.

## How It Works
1. Enter the cuisine type (e.g., "Italian").
2. List menu items (e.g., "Pasta, Pizza, Tiramisu").
3. The app generates a restaurant name tailored to the input.
